# Deathf

This is a discord bot developed for the Lifeline faction to help with revive requests and contract management.


# TODO 

- Allow requesting reviews for other players 
- Move verification in to its own function for consistency
- Log Revives in to a chanel
- Show start and end times in final report
- After ending contracts update lasts up to 60 seconds, this is close to unavoidable but should be possible to comunnicate to the user
